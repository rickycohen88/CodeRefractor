# Horiseon web page

## *Objective* 

    This Project is a Website Designed for a company that specilizes in image/and brand awarness.
    The task of this project was to take a mock up and make it a full featured demo page.
    There was an added task of making it more accessible without losing the original feel or content.

### Method

    I started by using some assets provied to me to meet the mockup. I then did some reaserch on accessability.<br>
    I found webaim.org (a group who focuses on web accesability) and through them the nfb(national federation for the blind).<br>
    The nfb put out a survey in 2016 on many topics but my key take-away was that there are many screen readers out there<br>
    with two leading in ussage(both in the 40%'s).One of them was on the fall and the other `NVDA` was on the rise.<br>
    i downloaded that software to try to familiarize myself with it whilst also doing some reading to try to find<br>
    wants and needs in the community.
